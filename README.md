**thread-scheduler** is a simple program to schedule tweets and threads on Twitter

At the moment it is being used as an internal tool without a graphical interface.

An open-source project with more functionality and complete documentation will be carried out soon.

If you want to use it, keep in mind that authentication (3-legged OAuth flow) defined by Twitter is required, the generated tokens go to the .env file.
In addition to an app with elevated privileges

You can see more information about this here:
